# My_Virus
A simple little virus I made

## Responsibillity 
It is your responsibillity what you choose to do with it
I am not and will not be acounted responsible for any damage, etc. that happens with this project
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!

## Note
Put the file in its own directory to damage no files

## A little explanation about what it does
It spam opens the same tab (A rickroll) (Can be updated for your own use I just put that there as a default tab to open) over and over again
Put in its own directory to cause no damage to other files
It will cause a crash/restart/shutdown

## Sources used
I used a mimo tutorial to make this
